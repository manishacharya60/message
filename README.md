I hope this message finds you well. My name is Manish Acharya, and I am reaching out on behalf of NPLCoder, a newly formed organization in Nepal dedicated to promoting competitive programming and AI/ML competitions. Our mission is to foster a vibrant coding community and encourage the next generation of Nepali students to engage in technology-driven solutions.

We were excited to begin our journey by setting up our online presence, and we noticed that the GitHub username "NPLCoder" is already taken by your account. Upon reviewing your profile, we saw that there has been limited activity, and we wondered if you might be open to discussing the possibility of transferring the username to our organization.

We completely understand the value and importance of usernames, and we would be extremely grateful for your consideration. If this is something you're open to, we would love to discuss the next steps or any terms you may have in mind. You can reach me at **manishacharya2060@gmail.com**, and I would be happy to answer any questions or provide more details about our organization.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this message, and we hope to hear from you soon.

Best regards,
Manish Acharya
NPLCoder Organization
